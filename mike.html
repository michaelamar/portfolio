			<p>Hi I'm Michael. I'm a full-stack engineer (that means I built this site all by myself) and I enjoy it. I live in Brooklyn, NY and have done so for all of my life-except for one gap year in Israel. I know some Rails, Ruby, JavaScript, jQuery, Html5, CSS3, & Git. I've played around with some wordpress and php as well. I enjoy reading & writing, sports, the NY startup community, politics- specifically <a href="http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/offices/studentaffairs/offices/ceo/government/budget.php">Participatory Budgetting</a> (PB), & hanging out with my friends and family.</p>
